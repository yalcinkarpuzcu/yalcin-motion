# saas-motion-kit

**Promo and motion videos for software products, made with [HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) and Claude Code.**

> **The one rule: no two films should feel like the same film.** Don't repeat effects, transitions or components. Invent a new component for every film. Decide the message and the tone before you pick a single effect.

This kit trains that creative muscle. It combines a staged process, a component strategy, **100 visual themes**, a **24-transition atlas** and a **variety audit** that catches repetition in your storyboard before you build it.

## What's new in v1.2: same story, six films

![The same 12-second script told in six themes, all six playing in sync](docs/six-films.gif)

- **[Same story, six films](examples/six-films).** One 12-second Acme Pulse script, six themes from the gallery, and six films that share the story and nothing else. Every storyboard passed the variety audit, and every film invented its own component: a metric stave (⌘K Keyboard Symphony), a rollback rolling pin (Clay Studio), a fineliner seismograph (Hand-Drawn Marker), a spot cue (Dark Keynote), a P1 gamepad (8-Bit Sidekick) and a halftone chart (Pop-Art Ben-Day). The shared [brief](examples/six-films/BRIEF.md) is included, so you can give it to your agent with a seventh theme. Watch the films on the [v1.2 release](https://github.com/tugrawork-creator/saas-motion-kit/releases/tag/v1.2).
- **`tools/pick_themes.py`** shortlists gallery themes for a tone and an audience, and skips the ones you used in your last five films:
  ```bash
  python tools/pick_themes.py --tone playful --audience "developers" --history ~/.motion-ledger.json
  ```
- **`tools/history_report.py`** turns your motion history into a one-page report: the transitions, entrances and eases you keep reaching for, and the atlas transitions and themes you have never tried. `variety_audit.py --append` now also takes `--theme NNN`, so the history knows which theme each film used.
- **A GitHub Action** ([`variety-audit.yml`](.github/workflows/variety-audit.yml)) audits every `STORYBOARD.md` on each push and pull request. A storyboard that repeats itself fails the check.
- **Template repository.** Click **Use this template** to start your own film repo with the tools, the creative rules and the audit Action already in place.
- **Before and after, side by side:** the Acme Suite loop's v1 and v2 play next to each other on the [v1.2 release](https://github.com/tugrawork-creator/saas-motion-kit/releases/tag/v1.2).

<details>
<summary><b>What was new in v1.1: the creative muscle</b></summary>

- **[`creative/`](creative)** is the new heart of the kit: seven questions to ask at every storyboard, a [tone matrix](creative/tone-matrix.md) ("I want to say ___ in a ___ tone") that maps tone to speed, eases, camera, colour, type, transitions and sound, the [variety rules](creative/variety-rules.md), and a [component forge](creative/component-forge.md) for inventing a new component in 15 minutes.
- **[Transition atlas](https://tugrawork-creator.github.io/saas-motion-kit/transitions/):** 24 *narrative* transitions (match cuts, carries, camera moves, masks, materials, time), each with a live demo, the tone it fits and what not to pair it with.
- **`tools/variety_audit.py`** reads the storyboard ledger and flags repeated transitions, entrances, eases, directions, uniform shot lengths, missing surprises, accent overuse, tone mismatches and missing new components. With `--history` it remembers your previous films, so you don't repeat your last three.
- **The Acme example, rebuilt as a lesson.** We ran the audit on our own first draft. It caught **11 repetitions**: the same turntable turn five times, the same title entrance, one ease everywhere, equal shot lengths and no surprise. v2 gives every product its own entrance (letters out of blur, mask wipe, a word carried between shots, drop from above), varies the turns (whip with motion blur, slow sine), uneven shot lengths, and one surprise where Forecast floods teal while the camera dollies in. Before and after are in [`examples/acme-suite-loop`](examples/acme-suite-loop), and the new render is on the [v1.1 release](https://github.com/tugrawork-creator/saas-motion-kit/releases/tag/v1.1).
- The storyboard template now opens with a **Message & tone** sentence and a one-row-per-shot **ledger**, and the `/saas-motion-video` skill runs a **creative pass** gate before any build.

## What's inside

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`creative/`](creative) | **The creative muscle:** the seven questions, tone matrix, variety rules, component forge and transition atlas |
| [`playbook/`](playbook) | A 7-stage production playbook with a review gate at each stage |
| [`components/`](components) | The **clean-or-imaginary** component rule: use the product's real UI when it is clean, otherwise design imaginary UI |
| [`docs/`](docs) | GitHub Pages: the **100-theme gallery** (4 key frames, component kit, motion notes and references per theme) and the **live transition atlas** |
| [`examples/six-films/`](examples/six-films) | **Same story, six films:** one 12 s script built in six themes, each with its storyboard, ledger and new component, plus the shared brief |
| [`examples/acme-suite-loop/`](examples/acme-suite-loop) | A complete HyperFrames project: a silent, seamless 40 s 3D booth loop, with its v1 → v2 variety-audit lesson |
| [`.claude/skills/saas-motion-video/`](.claude/skills/saas-motion-video) | A Claude Code skill that runs the whole process with you |
| [`templates/`](templates) | `BRIEF.md`, `STORYBOARD.md` and the theme-sheet template |
| [`examples/prompts/`](examples/prompts) | Real prompts that produced finished films, each with a fill-in template |
| [`tools/`](tools) | **Variety audit**, theme picker, history report, delivery (4K → 1080p/2K), loop-seam check, warm UI SFX synth, gallery builders |
| [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows) | The variety audit as a GitHub Action: every storyboard is checked on push and pull request |

## The process in one picture

```
1 Brief ──▶ 2 Components ──▶ 3 Theme ──▶ 4 Storyboard ──▶ 5 Build ──▶ 6 Sound ──▶ 7 Deliver
   ▲ gate      ▲ gate          ▲ gate      ▲ gate           ▲ gate      ▲ gate      ▲ gate
```

Each stage ends with a **human decision**. The agent does the production work; you bring taste at the gates. That split is what makes the result feel made by a person. See [`playbook/`](playbook).

At stage 4 the **creative pass** is mandatory: write the message-and-tone sentence, fill the ledger, run `python tools/variety_audit.py STORYBOARD.md`, then fix the repeats or mark them as deliberate `motif:`s.

## Clean components, or imaginary ones

Promo videos for software live or die on the UI you show. The rule:

1. **The product has clean UI** (consistent, uncluttered, current): capture it and animate the real components. Cards, tables, charts and toasts are rebuilt in HTML from your design tokens, not pasted in as screenshots.
2. **It doesn't** (legacy screens, dense admin panels, nothing designed yet): **design imaginary components**. These are simplified, idealised pieces of UI that tell the truth about what the product does, drawn in the brand's tokens.
3. **Never** fake capabilities, numbers or customers. An imaginary component may simplify the product but must not claim anything it doesn't do.

Details, a decision checklist and examples: [`components/`](components).

## 100 themes, one story

The same 45-second story about the fictional **Acme Pulse**, an AI that watches product metrics and flags anomalies, is drawn in 100 different visual languages across 10 families:

| Family | Themes |
|---|---|
| Product UI as the stage | 001–010 |
| Typography & graphic systems | 011–020 |
| Material & 3D | 021–030 |
| Light, optics & texture | 031–040 |
| Metaphor concepts | 041–050 |
| Signature directions | 051–062 |
| Data storytelling | 063–072 |
| Characters & mascots | 073–082 |
| Art movements & eras | 083–092 |
| Camera & edit grammar | 093–100 |

Each sheet shows **Hook → Reveal → Proof moment → CTA**. It also lists six components, three motion techniques with timings, the risk to watch for, how to adapt the theme to your own product, and references. Open the [gallery](https://tugrawork-creator.github.io/saas-motion-kit/), pick two or three themes, and put them in your brief.

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Node.js 22+, ffmpeg, Claude Code. HyperFrames downloads its own headless Chrome.

Click **Use this template** on GitHub to start your own film repo with the audit Action already wired in, or clone the kit:

```bash
# 1. get the kit
git clone https://github.com/tugrawork-creator/saas-motion-kit && cd saas-motion-kit

# 2. install the HyperFrames skills for Claude Code (not vendored here)
npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes

# 3. try the example
cd examples/acme-suite-loop
npx hyperframes preview          # live preview in the Studio
npx hyperframes render --quality delivery --resolution landscape-4k --output renders/loop-2160.mp4
```

Then open Claude Code in the repo root and start a video:

```
/saas-motion-video  Make a 45 s LinkedIn promo for https://your-product.com — theme 055 (Bento Grid), music-driven, no voiceover.
```

The skill walks you through the seven stages and stops at each gate.

## Rendered examples

Rendered MP4s are attached to the [Releases](../../releases) page, so the repository stays small. The [v1.2 release](https://github.com/tugrawork-creator/saas-motion-kit/releases/tag/v1.2) has the six films, their synced grid and the Acme v1/v2 comparison.

## Lessons that save hours

- **Render at 4K, deliver smaller.** Render `landscape-4k` or `square-4k`, then downscale with Lanczos (`tools/deliver.sh`). Edges, text and 3D come out visibly cleaner than a native 1080p render.
- **Seek-safe or it breaks.** Every frame must be a pure function of time: one paused GSAP timeline, Three.js driven from `hf-seek`, no `Date.now()`, no unseeded random.
- **Loops:** give every ambient motion a whole number of cycles per loop (`sin(2π·n·t/LOOP)`), and verify the seam with `tools/loop_check.py`.
- **Fonts with non-Latin characters:** ship `latin-ext` subsets locally. Built-in fallbacks silently lose glyphs such as ş, ğ and İ.
- **Uppercase text:** in some languages (for example Turkish) CSS `text-transform: uppercase` changes "i" into "İ". Type display text in uppercase yourself and set `lang` per word.
- **Sound:** pure sine blips sound thin and eerie. Warm tuned timbres (marimba or wood block in one key, short room reverb) feel friendly (`tools/warm_sfx.py`).
- **Less text.** If a viewer needs to read to follow the story, the visuals aren't doing their job. Keep on-screen words to labels and one line per beat.
- **No progress bars.** A timeline bar at the bottom makes a brand film look like a screen recording.
